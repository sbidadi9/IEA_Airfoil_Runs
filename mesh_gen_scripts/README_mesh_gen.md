The FFA-W3 airfoils, flat plate and cylinder meshes can be
generated by running create_grids.py. The python 
script requires chordwise points, "numpts"
and the name of the bluff body as inputs. 

For each AOA and Re=10M, Pointwise glyph script is executed
to generate a mesh with 525x288x121 points.

Note: Meshes for the airfoils and flat plate are generated
for 50 angles of attack between -180 and +180 degrees.
